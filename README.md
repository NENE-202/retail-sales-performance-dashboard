# Retail Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Why This Project Matters
Many small and medium-sized businesses generate sales data but struggle to turn it into meaningful insights. Without clear visibility into revenue trends, product performance, and regional results, decision-makers risk relying on guesswork rather than data.

This project demonstrates how **Excel dashboards and pivot tables** can transform raw sales data into actionable insights that support smarter, faster business decisions.

## ❓ Business Problem This Project Solves
The business faced three key challenges:
- Lack of clarity on **revenue performance over time**
- Difficulty identifying **high-performing products and categories**
- Limited understanding of **regional sales performance and gaps**

Without these insights, it becomes difficult to:
- Allocate inventory effectively  
- Focus marketing efforts  
- Improve underperforming regions  

This dashboard solves these problems by providing a **clear, visual summary of sales performance** across time, products, and regions.
